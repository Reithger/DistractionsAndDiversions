# DistractionsAndDiversions
Project for voice activated visual effects via the StylizedCaptions project I have also made. Primarily meant for novel visual effects based on spoken text during streams cause it's fun. Initially has a simple effect that makes all words spoken and picked up by the captioning software to appear on screen and bounce with simple physics rules.
